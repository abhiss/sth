Welcome to the Survive the Hunt Discord server! This server was made as a place for FailRace and Survive the Hunt (STH) fans to organize and play hunts with other fans. Our hunts tend to follow the rules in FailRace's STH videos. 

**Roles** We have roles for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC which can be "pinged" by anyone by mentioning the role (for example @Manager).  Platform roles can only be pinged if a hunt is likely (a couple people playing). Spam mentioning platform roles will get you muted. You should get your platform role in #claim-your-role to be alerted when someone is organizing a hunt on your platform. There's also a FiveM Helper role that you can get in #fivem-details, which i will ping when I need help testing something on the Survive the Hunt FiveM server.

**Channels:** 
\> Each platform has a category with text channels and a voice channel (VC). The hunt channels should only be for organizing or discussing hunts, but the VC can be used for other activities. 
\> PC has more channels, #fivem-discussion is to talk about the FiveM STH server. PC gets 3 voice channels because the FiveM Server uses @sthvBot#7348 to move members around.
\> General chat is used for discussions related to the this server and its members, including hunts, FailRace, GTA, FiveM, or even just saying hi :wave: . 
\> Suggestions is used to give suggestions on this Discord server and the Survive the Hunt FiveM server. 
\> Creators is a channel for people to share their STH videos or live streams. Content here must relate to this Discord server or the STH game mode.
\> Hunt Rules provides and outline of the rules in FailRace's STH videos and possible modifications that've been made.
\> info-drop and maps-library are unused. No one looks at #info-drop , but you can post your info for fun.
\> Any discussion not related to STH is welcome in #off-topic #memes #cars or #images-and-videos. Posts in these channels must also abide by the rules listed below.


**Moderation:**
The head moderator role is @Manager and currently has 1 member, me. You should dm me with questions or complaints regarding the server.

The second moderating role is @Chat Helper. They can kick people, delete messages, manage the platform roles, and change the discord server region.

Hunts are organized by @Planners. They are members that organize hunts and have the ability to tag players and post in channels where hunts are planned ( #pc-hunt-planning, #ps-hunt-planning, #xbox-hunt-planning ).
